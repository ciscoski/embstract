# run-clang-tidy

This document outlines the execution methods for `run-clang-tidy`, a tool that performs static analysis of C++ code to 
identify potential bugs and enforce coding style guidelines.

## Requirements

* clang >= 16.0

##  Leveraging a Compilation Database

`run-clang-tidy` relies on the compilation database generated by CMake (`compile_commands.json`).
This database stores information about the compiler flags used for each source file. 
Utilizing this database is the recommended approach for linting with `clang-tidy`.

### Linting all the code for a target

To perform a full linting analysis on all source files associated with a specific build target, use the following command:

```bash
run-clang-tidy -p [target_build_path] [other-options]
```

* `[target_build_path]`: The path to the build directory that contains the `compile_commands.json` file.
* `[other-options]`: (Optional) Flags to configure `run-clang-tidy` 
Use `run-clang-tidy --help` to view the complete list of available options.

### Linting selected files used for a target

```shell
clang-tidy -p [target_build_path] [other-options] <source0> [... <sourceN>]
```

* `[target_build_path]`: Path to target build path which contains the compilation database
* `<source0> [... <sourceN>]`: Path to source code to analyze (there can be multiple)

##  Manual Execution (Without Compilation Database)

!!! warning
    This method is less common but can be useful for smaller projects or testing purposes.
    It requires manually providing the compiler flags used for your project.

```shell
clang-tidy <compiler_flags> [options] <source0> [... <sourceN>]
```

Run the following command, replacing `<clang-tidy-path>` with the path to your `clang-tidy` executable, `<compiler_flags>` with the actual flags, and `<source_files>` with the list of source files to analyze:

* `<compiler_flags>`: Flags used by your compiler (e.g., -I<include_dir>)
* `[options]`: (Optional) Flags to configure Clang-Tidy (e.g., `--checks` to specify checks to run)
* `<source0> [... <sourceN>]`: List of source files to analyze

!!! Note
    When using the manual execution method, ensure the provided compiler flags accurately reflect those used during compilation to achieve optimal analysis results.
